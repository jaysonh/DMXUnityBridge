# DMXUnityBridge

## Overview
This Processing project connects with the DMXForARtistsWarehouse visualiser, which is a virtual light installation scene running in Unity. This Processing app sends DMX data over OSC to the Unity project so that you can see virtual lights behaving in the same way as real lights connected to your computer with an FTDI USB DMX device.

To use this example you must have Unity and Processing installed, and in Processing install the OSCP5 and DMXForArtists libraries through the libraries manager.
